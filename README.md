<h1 align='center'>Structural Analysis of a Bridge</h1>

<p align='justify'>Pedestrian bridges represent critical components of urban infrastructure, facilitating safe and efficient movement for
pedestrians while alleviating traffic congestion. This abstract provides an overview of a rigorous static structural
analysis performed on a pedestrian bridge, with a primary focus on evaluating its stability and strength under various
static loading conditions. The investigation employs state-of-the-art engineering methodologies, including finite
element analysis (FEA), structural modelling, and material characterization, to comprehensively assess the structural
performance of the bridge.</p>
